# DJOneHub for macOS

This branch adds a native macOS service for the DJI Cellular Dongle / Quectel
EG25-G. It does not require UTM for AT-mode management.

## Current scope

- Automatic discovery of DJI (`2ca3`) and Quectel (`2c7c`) USB serial ports
- Modem, SIM, operator, registration and signal status
- Receive and send SMS through the modem AT port
- Background call-state cache with missed-call history
- Native Swift incoming-call and SMS notifier
- Execute explicit AT commands
- USB network diagnostics, asynchronous DHCP repair, traffic counters and cellular history charts
- Experimental VoLTE call control and macOS audio bridge diagnostics
- Local management page at `http://127.0.0.1:7575`
- Packaged Apple Silicon release (Intel packaging is planned separately)

The cellular data interface remains managed by macOS. This allows macOS to use
the dongle as its network connection while DJOneHub uses a separate USB serial
interface for management.

## Downloaded release

The Apple Silicon ZIP contains the executable, its libusb runtime, native Swift
notifier, licenses and the `djonehub` terminal launcher. It does not require Go,
Homebrew or a separately installed libusb on the user's Mac.

From the extracted release directory:

```sh
./djonehub start
```

The terminal remains attached to the service and the management page opens
automatically. Press `Control+C` to stop it, or run `./djonehub stop` from another
terminal in the same directory. Logs are stored in
`~/Library/Logs/DJOneHub/djonehub.log`.

## Build from source

Requirements:

- macOS 13 or newer
- Go 1.26 or newer
- Swift 6 or newer

```sh
./scripts/package-macos-arm64.sh v0.1.0-preview
```

Release outputs:

- `dist/release/DJOneHub-macOS-arm64-v0.1.0-preview/`
- `dist/release/DJOneHub-macOS-arm64-v0.1.0-preview.zip`
- `dist/release/DJOneHub-macOS-arm64-v0.1.0-preview.zip.sha256`

The packaging script downloads the official libusb source archive, verifies its
SHA-256, builds it for macOS 13 or newer and bundles the resulting runtime.

## Run

Connect the modem and run:

```sh
./dist/djonehub-macos
```

If automatic discovery picks no AT port, inspect `/dev/cu.*` and pass it:

```sh
./dist/djonehub-macos -port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX
```

The server only listens on localhost by default. Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7575
```

## Demo without hardware

To explore the management page before buying the module, run:

```sh
./dist/djonehub-macos -demo
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:7575`. Demo mode provides simulated modem status,
SMS messages, AT command responses, network metrics and call states. It does not
access a real SIM, send messages, use cellular data or place a real call.

## Launch at login

```sh
./scripts/install-macos.sh
```

Logs are written to `~/Library/Logs/DJOneHub`.

## Platform limitations

- Native QMI/MBIM control, Linux udev and network-namespace orchestration are
  excluded from this macOS entry point.
- VoLTE call audio depends on the modem firmware accepting the PCM interface
  used by the experimental macOS audio bridge.
- The release uses an ad-hoc signature rather than an Apple Developer ID. On
  first run, macOS may require approval in Privacy & Security.
